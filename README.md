# Biodiversity In National Parks: Analyzing Species Distribution & Conservation

## Project Overview
This project explores biodiversity in U.S. national parks using species observation data. It includes **data analysis, statistical testing, visualizations, and predictive modeling** to identify patterns in conservation status and species distribution.

## Objectives
- **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Understanding species distribution across parks.
- **Statistical Analysis**: Chi-Square Test (species category vs. conservation status), ANOVA (species observations across parks).
- **Predictive Modeling**: Machine Learning to classify endangered species.

## Data Sources
- observations.csv
- species_info.csv

## Technologies Used
- **Python Libraries**: Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, SciPy, Scikit-Learn
- **Statistical Tests**: Chi-square, ANOVA
- **Machine Learning Model**: Random Forest Classifier

## Summary of Key Findings:

The Chi-square test showed a significant relationship between conservation status and specieis category. ANOVA analysis indicated significant biodiversity differences across national parks. The Random Forest model achieved **96.9% accuracy**, but struggled with detecting endangered species.

## Future Work
Improve predictive modeling with feature engineering, extend analysis with additional environmental factors, deploy an interactive dashboard
